# Javascript Session 2 starter files

Starter files:

- `index.html`
- `index.js`

The `index.js` is already be connected to the index.html on line 14. All you need to do is write your Javascript code in the index.js file and open the index.html in a browser.

Everytime you make a change in the index.js (and it's been saved) all you will need to do is refresh the `index.html` in the browser and you will see your changes come through.
